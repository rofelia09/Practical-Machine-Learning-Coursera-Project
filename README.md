## Practical Machine Learning

Introduction
This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise as described below. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data and the predictions are submitted in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.
